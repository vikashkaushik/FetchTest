1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I chose to code in java because that is my strongest language and I have a lot of experience in it.
 I used ArrayLists because it is easy to add transactions to it. You dont need to specify a 
 certain size when initializing it.
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
My solution has strong logic, but it is slightly in efficient. I feel like I have the skills to come
 up with good ideas to implement this project, however the run time is kind of bad. I used many 
ArrayLists throughout this program and it could have been more efficient if I implemented this 
with a Hashtable potentially.
3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
My favorite school project was a Chicago Bulls Statistic tracker I created for my final project 
in a mobile app developement class. I scraped data from a espn page with an extension about 
player's stats and used a csv file for many functions. I had graphs to potray leading scorers, 
you could add new players to the team. It was a very interesting project because I learned a lot of 
new skills and I love creating mobile apps.
